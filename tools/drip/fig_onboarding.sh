   ${BOLD}The Fig autocomplete box disappeared${NORMAL}
      This can happen if you hit 
         * ${BOLD}esc${NORMAL}
         * the ${BOLD}↑${NORMAL} up arrow too many times (after the up arrow shows your history, Fig hides until the next line)

      ${UNDERLINE}To bring it back${UNDERLINE_END}: hit the enter key on an empty line once or twice. It should reappear. 


   ${BOLD}Where is the Fig Menu${NORMAL}
      Click the Fig Icon (◧) in your Mac status bar (top right of your screen)


   ${BOLD}I don't see Fig popup next to my cursor${NORMAL}
      Hmm. Try some of the following to debug.

      1. Hit enter a few times then start typing. Maybe you hid it by hitting the up arrow key too many times.

      2. Make sure the Fig CLI tool is installed:
         * Go to Fig Menu (◧) > Settings > Developer > Install CLI Tool 

      3. Make sure Accessibility is enabled
         * Go to Fig Menu (◧) > Settings > Developer > Request Accessibility Permission
           (This should take you to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility)
         * Click the lock icon to unlock (it may prompt for your password)
         * If Fig is unchecked, check it. If Fig is checked, uncheck it then check it again.

      4. Toggle Autocomplete off and on again
         * Go to Fig Menu (◧) > Autocomplete 


      If the problem persists: please let us know! Contact the Fig team at hello@withfig.com


   ${BOLD}What does the ↪ symbol / suggestion mean?${NORMAL}
      This lets you run the command that's currently in your Terminal. 
      Sometimes Fig's autocomplete appears when you actually want to run a command. Rather than clicking escape or the up arrow, this lets you run the command by clicking enter.
   


   ${BOLD}I want to quit this onboarding / walkthrough${NORMAL}
      Hit ctrl + c



   ${BOLD}I want to quit Fig${NORMAL}
      * Go to Fig Menu (◧) > Quit Fig

   

   ${BOLD}I want to uninstall Fig${NORMAL}
      * Go to Fig Menu (◧) > Settings > Uninstall Fig
      3. If you're feeling generous, we would love to hear why you uninstalled Fig. hello@withfig.com
   


   ${BOLD}What is cd?${NORMAL}
      cd is a shell command that lets you change directories. e.g. cd ~/Desktop will change the current directory in your shell to the Desktop.

   ${BOLD}Note from Fig Team (11 Dec. 2020)${NORMAL} 
   For the moment, we (${BOLD}${MAGENTA}Fig${NORMAL}) have decided to focus on autocomplete / 
   intellisense for the Terminal. 

   When we launched, we were doing a lot: runbooks, apps, sidebar, shortcuts, 
   an app store for the Terminal… We tried to do too much too quickly.

   Limiting our focus to autocomplete in the short-term helps us make sure Fig 
   is a great experience. We plan to revisit everything mentioned above 
   (and more) very soon.

   Brendan & Matt
